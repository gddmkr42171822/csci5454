  \textbf{Integer Programming Problem}\\
  \\
  Assume each drone can communicate with any number of the $k$ stations. The
  constraint for this problem is that we have to use every drone but we don't
  have to use every station.  For this problem we want to minimize the sum of
  the cost of activating a station $a_j$ and the cost $c_{ij}$ of each of the
  drones communicating with that station.  In mathematical terms we are trying to 
  $$ 
  minimize\,\sum_{j=1}^{k} a_jx_j + \sum_{j = 1}^{k} x_j\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{ij}
  $$ 
  subject to the constraints
  \begin{enumerate} 
  \item
  $$
  x_j = 
  \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{ if we activate station }j\\
  0 & \text{ if we don't activate station }j\\
  \end{cases}
  $$
  \item
  Let $d_{ij} = 1$ if drone $i$ is communicating with station $j$ 
  then the mathematical notation for ensuring all drones are communicating with
  at least one station is 
  $$
  \forall d \quad \sum_{j=1}^{k} d_{ij}x_j \ge 1
  $$
  \end{enumerate}

  \textbf{Linear Programming Relaxation}\\
  \\
  The linear programming relaxation of this problem is still trying to
  $$ 
  minimize\,\sum_{j=1}^{k} a_jx_j + \sum_{j = 1}^{k} x_j\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{ij}
  $$
  but instead of $x_j \in \mathbb{Z}$ and being only 1 or 0 it can now be any
  number between 1 and 0.  $x_j$ is now $\in \mathbb{R}$.  The problem now
  though how do you round $x_j$ to make sure the constraint
  $$
  \forall d \quad \sum_{j=1}^{k} d_{ij}x_j \ge 1
  $$
  is still satisfied.  As was discussed in lecture you should use randomized
  rounding.
